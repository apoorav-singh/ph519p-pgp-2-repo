#  Project Title: ph519p-pgp-2-repo
This repository cantains all the code for simulation program that have been part of my academic course work (PH-519P).

# Description
This branch of code cantains the code for the Numerical solution of Quantum Harmonic Oscillator using Numerov's Method. This code is taken from the lecture notes of Paolo Giannozzi (University of Udine).

## Updates
This branch would not be merged as it would cantain the solution for diffrent problem, whereas main branch cantains the code for scattering of electron using the same technique i.e. Numerov's Method.
